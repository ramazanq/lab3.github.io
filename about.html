                <h3>OUR APPROACH</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our unique point-of-view and
                    approach
                    to consulting
                    engagements.</p>
                <p>The lens through which we view every consulting engagement is a Parallax View, which of course, as
                    the
                    definition of
                    "parallax" suggests, means that we take two alternate (but not necessarily opposing) views of every
                    problem, and compare
                    and contrast two alternate strategies for approaching the problem. This ensures that individuals,
                    teams
                    and management
                    do not become victims of their own paradigms (read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific
                    Revolutions
                    for more on
                    this), that we don't get lazy, and that we can assure our clients of the deepest and most creative
                    approaches to their
                    problems, every time.

                <h4>A PARALLAX PERSPECTIVE</h4>
                <p>
                    As we use the term, we mean taking a look at a task, assignment, problem from two different
                    points-of-view. To do this,
                    we assign two different teams to engage with an assignment and develop their own points of view, and
                    then present their
                    views to three referees, who then decide, based on the information that we have, which is the better
                    initial path to
                    pursue. But that is only the beginning of the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img/perspective.jpg" alt="The Parallax Perspective" class="floatRightImg"><br>
                    Throughout the engagement, we continue to use both points of view as a way of illuminating the
                    "space
                    between them," and
                    achieve greater clarity of observation and effectiveness of action.
                <article>
                    <p> In this way, we protect ourselves from falling victim to reinforcing our own paradigms.</p>
                </article>
                <p> Modeled after the great Greek Philosophy, our Parallax view outlines two opposing approaches to the
                    problems we try to
                    collaborate with our clients and resolve. On one hand we use empiricism, viewing what we know from
                    the
                    physical (senses)
                    perspective. We see, we feel, we acquire through being on the ground, talking to people, observing,
                    touching others
                    creations. On the other hand we use rationalism, thinking, reasoning, hypothesizing and abstracting
                    on
                    the way to
                    determine possible courses of action. We also use ethics, the deep understanding of good and bad,
                    right
                    or wrong, just
                    or not – in short morality.</p>
                <article>
                    <p> Our views, our processes and our protocols have been honed over and over again, with time,
                        maturing and
                        advancing over
                        time, as we have grown as an organization. We share these with our people, we share it with our
                        clients,
                        and we share it
                        with the world in our quest to Parallax things for the greater good.
